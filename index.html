  <h1> Little View Into My Life</h1>
    <p> HOWDY, I'm Jorge Kiesler, a Thomas Edison's attendee, and I am happy to present what I called the shop class hall of farmers.
     As of now, I have reached the age of 18. A number which means that by next year I'll be at my college classes trying to get a 
     degree out of my engineering major. What I'm doing in HTML has come naturally to me, and understanding coding language has come 
     accustomed. </p>
